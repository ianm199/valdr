# Benchmarks

First measurement against upstream Valkey. **No performance tuning has
been done yet** — these are baseline numbers from the same alpha binary
that the conformance tests run against.

## Methodology

Both binaries run on the same host, on different ports, sequentially
(not in parallel) to keep CPU contention out of the picture. We use the
official `valkey-benchmark` from upstream — anyone in the Redis/Valkey
ecosystem can read these numbers the same way they'd read upstream's own
benchmarks.

```bash
bash harness/bench/run.sh
# default: -n 1_000_000 -c 50 -P 100 -d 64 -t <standard suite>
```

The script writes a TSV to `harness/bench/results/<UTC>-<commit>.tsv`
recording the request count, client count, pipeline depth, payload size,
hardware fingerprint (CPU + OS + arch), and the commit hash so results
from different machines are not silently merged.

## Headline result (2026-05-20, alpha baseline)

**Hardware:** Apple M3 Max, macOS Darwin 24.3.0 (arm64)
**Workload:** 200,000 requests per command, 50 concurrent clients,
pipeline depth 100, 64-byte payload
**valkey-rs commit:** `a6ebea9`
**upstream Valkey:** pinned commit per `harness/source.toml`

## Reading this honestly

**Where we're slow (most simple commands, ~5-10% of upstream throughput):**
Per-command mutex lock acquisition dominates. Real Valkey is a
single-threaded event loop with no locks; we hold an `Arc<Mutex<RedisDb>>`
per request. On tight pipelined workloads where each operation is
~nanoseconds of work, the mutex acquire/release dwarfs the actual data
work. This is a known cost of safe-Rust shared-state design and is the
biggest perf target on the roadmap.

**Where we're competitive (LRANGE_100, ~95% of upstream):**
Once each operation does meaningful work (return 100 elements, ~6.4 KB
payload), the lock overhead amortizes and we're within noise of
upstream. The Rust data structures themselves are not the bottleneck.

**Where we're faster (LRANGE_300, 1.4× upstream):**
The larger the payload, the more our advantage. Reasons we suspect
matter here: Rust's `Vec<u8>` push + I/O write path may be marginally
better than upstream's reply buffer, and our RESP serializer is a tight
write-only path with no string-conversion overhead. Worth profiling.

**Per-op latency p99 is mostly competitive** even when throughput is
not — most commands' p99 latency is within 2× of upstream. The GET p99
of 18ms is an outlier we should investigate (probably a tail-latency
event from GC pressure or a lock-contention spike).

## What we'd improve

Roadmap to closer-to-parity throughput, in rough effort order:

1. **Shard the lock per key range** (or per-shard hash) — the easiest
   2-4× win for simple ops, since most ops touch a single key.
2. **`io_uring` on Linux** — replace blocking-thread I/O with the kernel
   submission queue. Big win on pipelined throughput.
3. **Read replicas of the keyspace via RwLock or DashMap** — `GET`-heavy
   workloads currently pay write-lock cost.
4. **Per-thread connection affinity** — pin a connection to a thread
   that owns a slice of the keyspace. The Garnet approach.
5. **Profile-guided optimization** — flamegraphs on the GET hot path,
   evaluate `jemalloc`/`mimalloc`.

These are post-alpha work; the perf gap is acceptable for the use cases
we're targeting now (single-node Valkey-compatible cache where wire
fidelity and safety matter more than raw throughput) but not for serious
production deployment.

## Reproducing

```bash
# One-time: build both binaries
bash scripts/setup-reference.sh
cargo build --release

# Run the standard suite (takes ~30s on M-series Apple silicon)
bash harness/bench/run.sh

# Smaller/faster smoke
bash harness/bench/run.sh --requests 50000 --pipeline 16

# Single command, no pipelining (latency-focused)
bash harness/bench/run.sh --requests 100000 --pipeline 1 --tests set,get

# Custom workload
bash harness/bench/run.sh --requests 500000 --clients 100 --pipeline 50 \
    --tests "set,get,zadd,zrange,xadd,xread"
```

Results land in `harness/bench/results/<UTC>-<commit>.tsv`. Each file
records the full configuration in TSV-comment headers so a future
maintainer can diff runs across hardware or commits.

## What this benchmark does NOT measure

- **Memory footprint.** Untracked today. Rust's allocator + `Arc<Mutex<>>`
  overhead vs upstream's hand-tuned slab allocator is the obvious place
  this matters; we should add a `valgrind --tool=massif` or
  `heaptrack` workflow.
- **Sustained throughput.** This is a 30-second blast. Real production
  latency stories live in the 1-hour soak. A `--duration 3600s` mode
  on the script is a future addition.
- **Tail latency under contention.** `valkey-benchmark` reports p50/p95/
  p99/max but not p999 or p9999. For latency-sensitive workloads, a
  proper HDR histogram with `memtier_benchmark` is the next tool.
- **Multi-client mixed workloads.** Reads + writes + range scans
  concurrently — closer to a real app. `memtier_benchmark` again.
- **TLS overhead.** All numbers here are plain TCP.
- **Persistence on the hot path.** AOF write costs aren't measured;
  bench runs use `--rdb-disabled --appendonly no` for both sides.
- **Network latency.** Loopback only.
